Plugin SDK for [**FrontFace** Digital Signage &amp; Kiosk Software](https://www.mirabyte.com/en/frontface/).

## About

The FrontFace Plugin SDK allows the creation of custom plugins for the FrontFace digital signage & kiosk software. Plugins are used to extend the functionality of FrontFace e.g., for displaying proprietary content types or for integrating external systems.

## Installation & Usage

In order to use this SDK, you should have C# programming skills and should be familiar with Microsoft Visual Studio.

Detailed information on how to create custom plugins for FrontFace can be found in the [SDK Documentation](Documentation/Documentation.md).

The included C# sample projects are provided in the ``\Sample Projects\`` folder of this repository.

To install the **Plugin Tester App**, please first download and install [FrontFace](https://www.mirabyte.com/en/frontface/download.html) (installation type *"Full Installation"*) on your development machine. Then download the Plugin Tester App from the [Releases](https://github.com/mirabyte/FrontFacePluginSDK/releases) section of this repository and extract the files into the installation folder of FrontFace (usually ``C:\Program Files\mirabyte\FrontFace\``). You can then start the Plugin Tester App by launching ``Plugin Tester.exe``.

> **Important:** Make sure that you download the version of the Plugin Tester App that matches with your FrontFace installation!
